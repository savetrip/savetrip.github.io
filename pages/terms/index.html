We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of www.savetrip.io, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via SaveTrip.IO (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our <a href=http://savetrip.io/pages/privacy/>Privacy Policy</a></p><p>We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using SaveTrip, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.</p><p>Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at <a href=mailto:support@savetrip.io>&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#97;&#118;&#101;&#116;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#46;&#105;&#111;</a>.</p><p><strong>Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website</strong></p><p>SaveTrip is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion.

You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using SaveTrip in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. "<a href=http://xkcd.com/936/>correcthorsebatterystaple</a>") and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.</p><p>It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete.
